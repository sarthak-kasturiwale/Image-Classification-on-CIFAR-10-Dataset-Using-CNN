# Image-Classification-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset-Using-CNN
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images of 10 different classes like cars, birds, dogs, horses, ships, trucks, etc. The idea of the project is to build an image classification model that will be able to identify what class the input image belongs to. 
# Data Information
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32Ã—32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. You can download the dataset from https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~kriz/cifar.html
# Approach of Problem Solving
1. Understanding the Problem  
2. Downloading the Dataset
3. Importing necessary Dependencies
4. Bringing the data to a format accpetable by CNN
5. Data Pre-processing
6. Building the Model
7. Evaluation of the Model
8. End Results
# End Results
- 87.28 % accuracy is not bad and there is lot to try, we have pretrained models, we have complex architectures. Also we can gather more data. If we have good computational resources we can play with batch size and learning rate. Which we will explor in other note books.
- This note book is a combination of multiple tutorials and different kaggle kernals. If you find this note books intresting run the code and play with parameters and see how it is behaving. If you know someother ways to improve accuracy beyond 87.28 please comment so that we can try.
- I read that using pretrained model will improve the accuracy a lot since the models already have certain filters or layers that are good at recognizing certain image. We will try that in a different notebook.
