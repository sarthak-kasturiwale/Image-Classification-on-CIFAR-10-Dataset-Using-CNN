# Image-Classification-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset-Using-CNN
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images of 10 different classes like cars, birds, dogs, horses, ships, trucks, etc. The idea of the project is to build an image classification model that will be able to identify what class the input image belongs to. 
# Data Information
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32×32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. You can download the dataset from https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~kriz/cifar.html
